- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant activities
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through rate limiting
- **Data Protection**: Sanitization and anonymization utilities

## Reporting Security Issues

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability in this tool or identify misuse:

1. **Do NOT** publicly disclose the vulnerability
2. Report to: `security@terragonlabs.com` (if this were a real project)
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow 90 days for responsible disclosure

### Required Information

When reporting issues, please include:

- Detailed description of the vulnerability or misuse
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation strategies
- Your contact information for follow-up

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

### For Researchers Using This Tool

When you discover vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations:

1. **Document Findings**: Create comprehensive documentation of the vulnerability
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate the practical impact and exploitability
3. **Contact Vendors**: Reach out to affected vendors/maintainers promptly
4. **Coordinate Disclosure**: Work with vendors on disclosure timeline
5. **Provide Mitigations**: Suggest concrete steps to address the vulnerability

### Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Initial discovery and verification
- **Day 1-7**: Contact affected parties
- **Day 8-90**: Coordinated vulnerability analysis and patching
- **Day 90+**: Public disclosure (if patch available) or extended timeline by agreement

### Emergency Disclosure

For critical vulnerabilities with active exploitation:

- Immediate notification to affected parties
- Accelerated disclosure timeline (7-30 days)
- Coordination with security response teams
- Public warning if necessary to prevent harm

## Security Features

### Authorization System

```python
from neural_cryptanalysis.security import ResponsibleDisclosure, OperationType

# Initialize security policy
policy = SecurityPolicy(
    max_traces_per_experiment=100000,
    require_written_authorization=True,
    audit_all_operations=True
)

disclosure = ResponsibleDisclosure(policy)

# Request authorization
token = disclosure.ensure_authorized(
    operation=OperationType.KEY_RECOVERY,
    target="authorized_test_implementation",
    justification="Security research with written authorization"
)
```

### Audit Logging

All security-relevant operations are logged:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "audit_type": "attack_attempt",
  "level": "WARNING",
  "target_algorithm": "kyber768",
  "attack_type": "neural",
  "traces_used": 50000,
  "success": true,
  "user_id": "researcher_001",
  "experiment_id": "exp_20240101_001"
}
```

### Data Protection

The tool includes utilities for protecting sensitive data:

```python
from neural_cryptanalysis.security import DataProtection

protector = DataProtection()

# Sanitize traces before sharing
sanitized_traces = protector.sanitize_traces(raw_traces)

# Anonymize results for publication
anonymized_results = protector.anonymize_results(attack_results)
```

## Compliance Requirements

### Legal Compliance

Users must ensure compliance with:

- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU
- Local cybersecurity and privacy laws
- Institutional policies and ethics boards

### Research Ethics

For academic use:

- Obtain IRB approval if required
- Follow institutional cybersecurity policies  
- Respect intellectual property rights
- Collaborate ethically with other researchers

### Industry Use

For commercial security assessment:

- Obtain proper contracts and authorization
- Follow industry best practices
- Maintain client confidentiality
- Document all activities for compliance

## Security Hardening

### Deployment Security

When deploying the tool:

```bash
# Use non-root user
docker run --user cryptanalysis neural-crypto-prod

# Limit resources
docker run --memory=4g --cpus=2 neural-crypto-prod

# Network isolation
docker run --network none neural-crypto-prod
```

### Configuration Security

```yaml
security:
  enable_responsible_disclosure: true
  max_attack_iterations: 100000
  require_authorization: true
  audit_logging: true
  rate_limit_attacks: true
  embargo_period_days: 90
```

### Access Control

- Implement proper authentication for multi-user deployments
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security audits and updates
- Monitor for unusual activity patterns

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

**Critical**: Immediate threat to systems or data
**High**: Significant security implications
**Medium**: Moderate security concern
**Low**: Minor security issue

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Response**: Stop operations, isolate systems
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further damage
4. **Investigation**: Determine root cause
5. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update policies and procedures
