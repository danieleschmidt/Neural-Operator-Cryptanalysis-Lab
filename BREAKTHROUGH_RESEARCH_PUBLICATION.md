## 1. Introduction

The emergence of post-quantum cryptography necessitates advanced security evaluation techniques capable of analyzing complex lattice-based, code-based, and hash-based schemes. Traditional side-channel analysis methods struggle with the sophisticated mathematical structures and novel countermeasures employed in these implementations. This work introduces Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), a breakthrough approach that incorporates fundamental electromagnetic and circuit physics into machine learning models for enhanced cryptanalytic capabilities.

### 2.1 Neural Operators in Scientific Computing

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown remarkable success in solving partial differential equations across various scientific domains. However, their application to security and cryptanalysis remains unexplored. Our work bridges this gap by adapting physics-informed techniques to the unique challenges of side-channel analysis.

### 2.2 Side-Channel Analysis Evolution

Traditional side-channel attacks rely on statistical methods (DPA, CPA) or machine learning approaches (template attacks, neural networks). Recent advances include:
- Deep learning for trace analysis

Each requires specialized analysis techniques that our physics-informed operators provide.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Physics-Informed Neural Operator Architecture

Our breakthrough architecture integrates three fundamental physics components:

#### 3.1.1 Maxwell Equation Constraints

```
∇ × E = -∂B/∂t

```

These equations are incorporated as learnable constraints in the neural operator training process, ensuring physically consistent electromagnetic field predictions.

CMOS power consumption modeling:
```
P_dynamic = α · C · V² · f
P_static = I_leak · V
