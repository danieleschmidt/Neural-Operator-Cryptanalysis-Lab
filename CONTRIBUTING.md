## Testing Requirements

### Test Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/                   # Unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/           # Integration tests

```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
import torch
import numpy as np
from neural_cryptanalysis.neural_operators import FourierNeuralOperator

class TestFourierNeuralOperator:
    """Test Fourier Neural Operator implementation."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def fno_model(self):
        """Create FNO model for testing."""
        from neural_cryptanalysis.neural_operators.base import OperatorConfig
        config = OperatorConfig(input_dim=1, output_dim=256, hidden_dim=32)
        return FourierNeuralOperator(config, modes=8)
    
    def test_forward_pass(self, fno_model):
        """Test forward pass functionality."""
        x = torch.randn(4, 100, 1)
        output = fno_model(x)
        
        assert output.shape == (4, 256)
        assert not torch.isnan(output).any()

        """Test parameter initialization."""
        for param in fno_model.parameters():
            assert not torch.isnan(param).any()
            assert param.requires_grad
```

```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def neural_attack(traces: np.ndarray, 
                 model: torch.nn.Module,
                 strategy: str = 'direct') -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Perform neural operator-based side-channel attack.
    
    Args:
        traces: Side-channel traces for attack
        model: Trained neural operator model
        strategy: Attack strategy ('direct', 'template', 'adaptive')
        
    Returns:
        Attack results containing success rates and recovered keys
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If traces are invalid or model is not trained
        SecurityError: If operation is not authorized
        
    Example:
        >>> traces = load_traces('target_traces.npy')
        >>> model = load_model('trained_model.pth')
        >>> results = neural_attack(traces, model, strategy='adaptive')
        >>> print(f"Success rate: {results['success_rate']:.2%}")
    """
```

### API Documentation

- Include type hints for all public APIs
- Provide comprehensive examples
- Document security considerations

### Tutorials and Guides

- Step-by-step tutorials for common use cases
- Best practices guides

## Security Considerations

### Security Review Process

All contributions undergo security review:

1. **Automated Security Scanning**: Bandit, safety, and other tools  
2. **Manual Security Review**: For security-sensitive changes
3. **Threat Modeling**: For new features
4. **Penetration Testing**: For significant changes

### Security Requirements

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authorization Checks**: Implement proper access controls
- **Audit Logging**: Log security-relevant events
- **Error Handling**: Don't leak sensitive information in errors

### Responsible Disclosure

Contributors must follow responsible disclosure:

- Report vulnerabilities privately first
- Allow 90-day embargo period
- Coordinate with maintainers on disclosure
- Provide mitigation recommendations

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/neural_cryptanalysis/

# Security checks
bandit -r src/neural_cryptanalysis/
safety check
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 4.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
  
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/bandit
    rev: 1.7.4
    hooks:
      - id: bandit
        args: ['-r', 'src/']
```
